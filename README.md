# Math-142-Letter-to-a-Farmer

Project Summary

Problem E of the 2025 ICM tasks us with developing a model that captures the agricultural evolution of a
farm established on newly cleared forest land. The problem incorporates both natural ecological processes and
human interventions, like the use of pesticides and fertilizers, which support crop growth but negatively impact
insect and bird populations.

To address this, we structured our model into three distinct stages:
1. Stage 1: Early Development – Here, the ecosystem is unstable. The soil requires fertilization, crops
depend on pesticides to avoid destruction by insects, and birds are the only natural predators of insects.

3. Stage 2: Transitional Phase – The land begins to recover, allowing the return of native species such as
bats, which also prey on insects. During this stage, we reduce pesticide use as we initiate a shift toward
more sustainable practices.

5. Stage 3: Going Green – We fully transition to eco-friendly methods, or “going green.” This step eliminates
all pesticide and fertilizer use. At this point, the farm ecosystem is allowed to develop naturally
